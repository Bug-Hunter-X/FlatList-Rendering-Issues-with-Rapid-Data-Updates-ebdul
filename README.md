# React Native FlatList Rendering Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug in React Native's FlatList component when dealing with rapidly updating large datasets. The bug manifests as visual inconsistencies, including blank spaces, incorrect item ordering, and generally unreliable rendering.

## Bug Description

When the data source of a FlatList is frequently updated with a significant number of items, the component may fail to update the UI accurately. This leads to a degraded user experience.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` (or iOS equivalent).
4. Observe the erratic behavior of the FlatList as the data updates.

## Solution

The solution involves implementing more efficient data management techniques and potentially using the `keyExtractor` prop more effectively.  See the `bugSolution.js` file for a corrected version.  Key improvements include better data handling, use of `extraData` for more efficient updates and potentially using `windowed` or `virtualized` list components for larger datasets.
